# User Experience Process

This provides a basic and forkable starting point for user experience work, with folders for different parts of the process.

## What this includes

Because user experince is a vast and fairly ill-defined field, it's helpful to define what this process includes, at this point.

- Design strategy
- Content strategy
- Information architecture
- Design research
- Evaluative research
- Interaction design
- Visual design

While some of these, especially content strategy and visual design, are not necssarily always part of what a UX person does, it's quite often the same group doing all of these things and even when it isn't it's still necessary to have a common understanding.

## What this does not include

- Front end development (beyond prototyping)
- Back end development
- Mobile app **development**
- Something that can be used without changing it to reflect the needs of clients, users, etc.
