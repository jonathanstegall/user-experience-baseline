# Small, internal project kickoff

I realize doing a full stakeholder interview is not realistic or necessary if you're a person who works with the same people on internal projects all the time. But projects could still get off on a much better foot by learning some of the same information, albeit in a different way.

1. What is the problem, as you see it?
2. What person or group of people has this problem? You can have multiple answers for this, but each one needs to be a distinct unit.
-- 2a. For each of these, how do you know they have this problem?
3. What will change for you, as the person saying there's a problem, if it gets solved?
