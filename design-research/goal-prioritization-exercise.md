When doing a goal prioritization exercise with stakeholders, each goal should be ranked by how important it is, and by how severe it is. Priority is how important it is, and severity is an attempt to say how urgent the status quo is. That is, how urgent is it that this goal be resolved?

There isn't really a maximum number of goals, but more than 7 will be difficult to achieve in this kind of project.

## Goal table

| Goal | Priority | Severity |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| A goal specific enough to know if you've achieved it | How important is this goal?  | How severe is the current state of this goal? |
| Total | Number of goals x 3  | Number of goals x 3  |

## Ranking goals

Once the stakeholder has identified all of their goals, rank the priority and severity for each goal. The total number of points is the number of goals multiplied by three. Then, ask the stakeholder to distribute those points until they're all accounted for. Most people will adjust the numbers as they go; that's fine.

### For example:

| Goal | Priority | Severity |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Increase conversion rate by 5% | 4  | 3 |
| Decrease system errors by 50% | 2  | 2 |
| Increase fundraising by 10% | 3  | 4 |
| Total | 9  | 9  |
