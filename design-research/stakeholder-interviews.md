# Stakeholder Interviews

Use this to learn about the project and the business from the client, and as preparation for further research. These questions cover goals and metrics, roadmap (a very basic one at this stage), audiences, competition, any existing research, and what the stakeholder would like to learn.

When possible, do these individually and with as many people vested in the project as possible; but it can certainly be done successfully in groups as well. The goal is to avoid people coming into the project later with information that causes problems or significant directional changes.

## Stakeholder questions

1. What do you do? Why?
-- Not interested in job title here, but what the daily job is. Alternatively, ask "what are your essential duties and responsibilities" or "what does a typical day look like for you"? Different customers will benefit from different ways of framing this.
-- The goal here is to get them thinking deeper than what they'd like the site to look like/do, and think about what it actually means to their business.
2. How do you know if you are successful?
3. Who are the people and teams you work/communicate most closely with?
4. If this project is successful, what impact will that have on your job?

## Site roadmap
1. What are upcoming goals, milestones, or decisions for this product, service, business, etc.?
- There is a lot of room for variety here, as you can focus more on the business or more on the product itself, depending on which one will provide more useful information.
2. What are the biggest risks to the success of the project?
3. What information could help you make decisions or prioritize your efforts?
4. Existing sites only: What's the story of how we got to this point?

## Users
1. Who are your target users (or user groups)? What distinguishes them? (e.g. demographics, usage patterns, needs, expectations, pain points, etc.)
2. Which users are currently top priority for you? Why?
3. What do you want to learn about users?
4. What is the role you want to play in your customers' lives?
5. What are the current advantages/disadvantages you have in fulfilling this role?

## Goals and metrics
1. What is the organizational mission statement?
- Sometimes this question is redundant or not helpful. If you feel like it adds value - to you or the customer - ask it. If not, skip it.
2. What are the overall business goals?
- This is another one that has some flexibility. The question can relate to what the business needs to do as a whole, or to what this specific project needs to do to be successful. Sometimes both are useful; sometimes one or the other.
- It can also be helpful to include goal prioritization exercises at this point. It can help folks think about constraints of importance (how much of a difference the goals make) and severity (how much the current state hurts).
3. What assumptions do you have about this project?
4. What do you expect a successful project will be like?
- What will it do?
- What features will it have?
- What will it be like to use it?
5. What risks do you see in this project?
6. Who is responsible for what in this project?
7. How will you measure performance and success of this product?
8. Do you have data that need explanation or that have already highlighted existing UX issues?

## Competition
1. What are the closest competitors for the business, and also (if applicable) for the website, any specific features individuals are aware of, etc.?
2. How does this compare to competitors?
3. What behaviors, conventions, or expectations might users have based on this competition?

## Existing research
1. What data are you currently collecting (e.g. analytics, A/B testing, user support/other interactions, surveys, usability)?
2. What have you learned from the data/feedback youâ€™re collecting?
3. What kinds of research efforts have been most/least valuable to you in the past? Why?

## Research needs and impact
1. What are your three wishes for intelligence about your users, competitors, etc.?
2. Imagine the most useful, actionable research results possible.
- What would they tell you?
- How would you use them?
