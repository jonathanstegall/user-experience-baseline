# Research Goals and Questions

Once you've done stakeholder interviews, you should have a sense of what it will take for your project to succeed, and also what your project can do for the overall success of the organization.

And once you have that, you need to define how your research will help you achieve that. What questions will your research answer? What goals will it achieve that lead to overall success?

If you have them, this is a good time to incorporate mission statements, project briefs, requirements documents, subject matter experts, assumptions and risks, who is responsible for what, and so on.

## Research Goals

Define what you want as an outcome. What do you want to understand? What assumptions do you currently have that need to be tested? These goals provide a structure for research, not activities for research (usabiliy testing, field research, user interviews, etc.). You need to understand what you want to achieve before you decide how to achieve it.

## Research questions

It can be helpful to define and prioritize your research goals first, and then create questions for each goal. You can go through multiple iterations of this to get your questions to be as specific as possible.

I've found that in some projects it is better to define the questions first, then figure out what goals they achieve, and then think about whether those goals are really the right ones. Then I can make more or edited questions. That feels a little off, but for some projects it works better.

Questions can be based on anything, but some areas that can be helpful include:
- Environments (where users are)
- Subjects (who users are)
- Objectives (what users want to do)
- Outcome (what actually happens for users)
- Constraints
- Community (who else is involved in a user's interactions with you and what are their roles?)
- Motivations (hopes, dreams, fears, reasons for doing things)

## Prioritizing goals and questions

Once you have your goals and your questions, you need to prioritize your efforts. This will, in turn, help you structure and prioritize the actual research activities.

### How do you answer this question?
Consider how your question can be answered. Do you have to do user research, field research, usability testing to find out? Because these activities are expensive and need to be conducted by someone qualified to do them, take special note of that.

Some questions will have easy answers. Maybe you can go ask someone what percentage of users successfully perform a series of tasks, or go look at search logs, analytic data, or any other kind of data that is floating around the organization. Take note of that too, as it can save a great deal of time if you don't have to work hard to get the answers you need.

### How important is this question?
Consider how much the organization needs to know the answer to this question. Sometimes organizations will make this decision for you, and sometimes that decision may not be the best one, but you still need to consider it.

### How much does it hurt?
You should consider how much the current state of things for any given question hurts the organization. Is the gap between where they currently are and where they'd like to be very large? This can be a bit hard to measure, but most organizations know where they hurt.
