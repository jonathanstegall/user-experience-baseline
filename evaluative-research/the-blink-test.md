# The Blink Test

The blink test can be done alongside usability testing. Sometimes it can be done as part of a usability test, but it can also be done with a team that's working on a project.

You can do this with an existing website (perhaps to see some of the problems it has), with a prototype (maybe to see how well it solves problems you know about), or with a new design language (to see what it communicates and how).

## Process

Close your eyes, step back, and take a moment. Then open your eyes and listen to what you are feeling. Observe that first moment and ask yourself the following questions:

- What do I notice?
- How does this feel?
- Is this prototypical?
- What can I do?

## After observing

It's good to answer these questions with as much rapid response as you can, but after that it is important to reflect on what the answers tell you. Pay special attention to anything in the answers to all these questions that surprises you.

### What do I notice?

Pay attention to the things that drew your attention. What are they? Are they imagery, type, color, specific language? Is the design drawing attention to the wrong things, or in the wrong priority?

### How does it feel?

Examine the list here and think about whether these are the kind of feelings you want to create. Whether this is with users or with a team, no one's feelings about a design are invalid, but the implications are different.

Does this design potentially create emotions that aren't right for users, or aren't right for them at the time it creates them? Does it avoid creating emotions when it should?

### Is it prototypical?

Prototypical, in the general sense, means it has the typical qualities of a group, person, thing. That is: does this design have the kind of qualities that you would expect it to have based on the people or groups who use it. Part of the power here is knowing what kind of expectations users have, through interviews or other testing or whatever.

Now, whether it does or not, how is that good and bad? Expectations are not necessarily neutral, but neither are they only good or only bad. What's bad is when we don't know what the expectations are or why they exist.

### What can I do?

Take a look at everything you've observed, and figure out what you can do about it. How can the design change based on these observations?
