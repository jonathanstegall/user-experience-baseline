## Introduction

Hi, []. My name is [].

You probably already know, but let me explain why we've asked you to come here today: We're testing [] to see what it's like for actual people to use it.

To start, this is probably the one time today when there is nothing you can do wrong. I'd like to make it clear that we're testing the website, not you. If things don't work, it's not you and we want to know so we can try to make it better. So feel free to be as honest as possible.

As we go along, I'm going to ask you to think out loud, to tell me what's going through your mind. This will help us.

If you have questions, just ask. I may not be able to answer them until after, since we are testing the website, but if you still have them when we're done I can try to answer them.

If you don't mind, we'd like to use this software and microphone to record our session. It will record whatever you do on the screen, and also our voices as we talk. It will only be used by folks on our team, to try to improve what we're doing.

Do you have any questions before we begin?

## Background information questions

Before we look at the site, I'd like to ask you just a few quick questions. First, what's your occupation?

Good. Now, roughly how many hours a week would you say you spend online? What kind of things do you do there?

What kind of devices do you use (ex phone, laptop, tablet).

Do you have any favorite Web sites?

OK, great. We're done with the questions, and we can start looking at things.

## Usability test

First, I'm just going to ask you to look at this page and tell me what you think it is, what your impressions are, and what you think would happen if you clicked things (you don't need to click anything yet).

And again, as much as possible, it will help us if you can try to think out loud so we know what you're thinking about.
